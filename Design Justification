THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL DESIGN:

We considered using a 2d ArrayList to create the map on which the player moves. However, we decided on this method of rooms
because it proved to be easier for both us as coders and for the user. From a coding standpoint, there would be no inherent
association between the objects and the map. Having a system of rooms, each room can be initialized with an object. For doors
as well, we would have been left with little option but to just remove them from the 2d array list. But, with our room option,
our doors continue to exist and can be entered from in either direction. Pretty cool, right? This allows for our code to be
extensible so that future coding geniuses can possibley lock doors or interact with them even after they have been opened the
first time. From a user standpoint, it would be a pain to have to enter 'go north' for each little tile. Having a system of rooms, the 'go north' is quite a bit more meaningful, letting them enjoy the meat of the game: our lovely descriptions.

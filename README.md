## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?

 We approached this project by first creating a story line that utilizes a map. We then went through the rubric adding additions to the baseline. Starting from small ideas and building up.

 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
 We learned how to parse and analyze user input and how to utilize doors in our game with the full aspect of having to unlock it.

 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
 We wish we would have implemented a more imersive user interface, to accept more user imput.

 We would have implemented extra user features, a clown that follows the player (rather than randomly moving), and we would have implemented way to provide unique descriptions based off of which direction you entered the room from.

 Nicole gave us the most useful feedback which was to make to make the starting text more user friendly and readable.

 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
 We would hint at ourselves to take it easy and not get ahead of ourselves because we wanted to implement a lot of interesting things. Also that youtube videos are very helpful to learn thank you Huvstube

 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.
 Elsie drove me, scarlett, insane. We were able to lock in for 9 hours straight until 5am. This is Elsie now. Scarlett is crazy sometimes and any bugs were all her. But we made an excellent team and absolutely rocked thissss
